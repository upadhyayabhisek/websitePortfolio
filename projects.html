                    “Student Record System” is developed to maintain the details of student such as first name, last
                    name, gpa, course in any school or any educational institute. Every institute uses a way of record
                    system to save the information of the students there. As in various rural areas it is found that
                    educational institute uses physical method of record keeping meaning with copies and paper etc.
                    There is various system which can do this work but are costly as well as have difficult for beginner
                    to operate for institutions present in rural areas. Our project makes a system for solving record
                    keeping problem for cheaper cost as well with an easy menu system. <br>
                    In conclusion this system is able to perform operations such as input, search through multiple data
                    entries, delete existing record and change existing record along with a security of login system.

                    The Helicopter Game is a project based on the C++ programming language that tries to
                    recreate the popular game Flappy Bird, which includes additional features such as various
                    backgrounds, a menu system and a score display. This project brings an immersive and
                    engaging gaming experience and challenges players to guide the helicopter through
                    hurdles while trying not to collide with the hurdles. <br>
                    Helicopter Game&#39;s core gameplay mechanics take inspiration from Flappy Bird and allow
                    players to control the height of the helicopter using the spacebar. The goal is to navigate
                    the helicopter through a series of obstacles such as pipes moving from right to left on the
                    screen without colliding with them while also not allowing the helicopter to touch the
                    ground. The project uses the C++ programming language and implements accurate
                    object-based movement collision detection to ensure an enjoyable gaming experience.

            <h2>Collision Detection System</h2>
            <p>This project was developed using C programming language and 8051 microcontroller as part of
                our coursework for the third
                semester. We also gained knowledge of Assembly language during the course of this project</p>

                    The Collision detection system is a project based on 8051 microcontroller and C
                    programming language, which uses ultrasonic sensors along with various other
                    electronics. This project is designed to enhance safety and aid in navigation by providing
                    detection of edges of a defined space. An ultrasonic sensor is employed to measure
                    distance by emitting sound waves and an 8051 microcontroller processes this information
                    to trigger the alert mechanism. <br>
                    The main components of the system are, 8051 microcontroller, LCD, Ultrasonic sensor
                    and a buzzer. The ultrasonic sensor uses sound wave transmission to determine the
                    distance of any object within the range of the sensor, which is then forwarded to the
                    microcontroller, which acts as a central processing unit. The microcontroller uses the
                    time taken by sound waves to return along with speed of sound to calculate the
                    approximate distance of the object, which is displayed on the LCD. If the range exceeds
                    predefined distance, it triggers the buzzer signaling the user. <br>
                    This is a versatile system, which allows for integration into various applications such as
                    robotic navigation, security system, alert system etc. This project helps to provide a
                    safety mechanism to prevent various accidents caused by human error. As it is a versatile
                    system, it can be used in various ways. <br>
                    Overall, the collision detection system offers an accessible and useful solution for
                    monitoring of the surroundings. The use of an 8051 microcontroller along with LCD and
                    ultrasonic sensors provides a responsive collision detection mechanism, which enhances
                    safety in diverse environments.
